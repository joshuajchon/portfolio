                <p class="col-sm-6">For the Scratch Project, my partner 
                and I created a game using Scratch, a online visual programming language.
                This game was based on the Impossible Game that we were familiar
                with. Both of us were responsible for similar things when creating the game. 
                We worked on background designs, comments, and game functions together. After the
                end of each class, we discussed whether or not we needed to get work
                done at home. We were also able to divide the work evenly between one
                another so that none of us felt overwhelmed with too much work. Since
                we were able to communicate and work well with each other, our project
                was completed on time with a good amount of comments to remind us what
                certain parts of our code did. Throughout the creation of our game, 
                I was able to learn more about the introduction to coding. The Scratch
                Project helped me realize how important comments are when I have alot
                of code. It also helped me learn that there is a lot of trial and 
                error involved. If our code did not work the first time, my partner 
                and I had to constantly attempt to tweak our code block and analyze 
                it in order to make our game work.
