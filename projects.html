            <p class="col-sm-5">For the Scratch Project my partner 
            and I created a game using Scratch, a online visual programming language.
            This game was based on the Impossible Game that we were both familiar
            to. Both of us were responsible for the same thing. We worked on 
            background designs, comments, and game functions together. After the
            end of each class, we discussed whether or not we needed to get work
            done at home. We were also able to divide the work evenly between one
            another so that none of us felt overwhelmed with too much work. Since
            we were able to communicate and work well with each other, our projects
            was completed on time with a good amount of comments to remind us what
            certain parts of our code did. Throughout the creation of our game, 
            I was able to learn more about the introduction to coding. The Scratch
            Project helped me realize how important comments are when I have alot
            of code. It also helped me learn that there is a lot of trial and 
            error involved. If our code didnâ€™t work the first time, my partner 
            and I had to constantly attempt to tweak our code block and analyze 
            it in order to make our game work. </p>
