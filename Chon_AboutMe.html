            Hello, my name is Joshua Chon and I am a Freshman at Dublin High School.
            As a current student, I am veryinterested in engineering, mostly
            related to coding. While spending 4 key years in High School, I plan
            to learn a lot more about the differenttypes of software engineering,
            and possibly some parts of hardware engineering. With this knowledge,
            I want to continue to pursue a profession related to coding. In order
            to do this, I want to start taking extra classes outside of school to
            put me ahead of the basic curriculum taught in class. However, I will
            also begin to volunteer and participate in clubs that will enable me
            to use the skills I have while also collaborating with others. The 
            engineering field is my career choice because of how familiar I am with
            it. My father is an engineer who works at Google, and my sister is also
            pursuing an engineering career. Since the majority of my family has 
            work related to this field, I became interested in it starting from 
            an early age, and now this is a goal of mine as well.
            <br>
            <br>I believe that I have several characteristics and experiences which
            relate to this career. First, I am an extremely organized person. 
            Whenever I have a lot of work to do, or it is simply just a busy day,
            I like to plan out how I am going to work and when to do it. I essentially
            create a schedule for myself so that I do not begin to procrastinate
            or forget to do something. I feel like without staying organized, it
            would be difficult to get all your work done quickly and efficiently.
            I am also a great leader who can communicate with their partners. When
            playing sports such as basketball and fencing, I enjoy helping people
            learn how to get better as well find out a way to beat the opponent 
            together. As a result, I have won many competitions for fencing and 
            have been to the nationals for about 4 years in a row. 
            <br>
            <br>Recently, I have participated in several camps, some that taught
            me how to code in C++ and Python. As a freshman, I have also signed 
            up for many clubs, but have been very active in Key Club. Key Club is
            a student-led international organization which provides service and 
            volunteer opportunities. During late October of 2018, we went to Six
            Flags as a club, to raise awareness for the Pediatric Trauma Program.
            There, I was able to meet new people and represent our school. 
            Throughout my short experience as a high schooler, I have learned much
            more about myself. Since I am part of a fencing team outside of school
            and I have taken advanced classes, I began to teach myself how
            to manage my time well. I have also realized that I am capable of working
            for a long period of time until I finish what needs to be done. When
            I was in middle school, I used to always get distracted by my surrounding,
            but that habit has mostly disappeared now. I am also taking Algebra 2
            Trig and Advanced English which can be time-consuming. I began to start
            assignments earlier in the day so I do not pile myself with a huge 
            workload late at night. Through my experiences so far, I have learned
            that I can easily adjust to an increase amount of work and even changes
            in general.
            <br>
            <br>To ultimately reach my goal of pursuing a career as an engineer,
            I am developing the skills and creating experiences that will teach 
            me what it takes to become the engineer I want to be. I greatly 
            appreciate the time you have taken to learn about me and I advise you
            to look all throughout my webpage to learn even more.
